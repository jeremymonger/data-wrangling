# Data Wrangling
This was a Udacity project to help practice data wrangling skills. I collected data from three sources about the WeRateDogs twitter account and cleaned up the various issues they had had. Here are the files to help you get started:

### wrangle_act :
Where I did the actual work.

### wrangle_report :
A brief explanation of the choices I made while wrangling the data

### act_report :
A simple attempt at communicating the finding after exploring the dataset.
